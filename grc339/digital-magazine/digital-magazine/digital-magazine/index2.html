                            <h2>Champion Kelly Slater Gets Wildcard After Not Qualifying for WSL Tour</h2>
                    
                                <p>American great Kelly Slater will continue on the World Surf League tour after the 11-time world champion was awarded a wildcard. Slater’s year looked over when he missed the mid-season cut at the Margaret River Pro, which remained on hold on Thursday for a fourth consecutive day. </p>
                               <p>The 51-year-old was eliminated in the third round by Australian Liam O’Brien, which meant he was unable to climb the rankings into the top 22 who continue beyond the tour’s fifth stop. However the WSL announced on Thursday that Slater and France’s Johanne Defay, who finished as world No 3 last year, would receive the 2023-24 wildcards.</p>

                                <p>They can also accrue rankings points to try to push into the top five who will compete in the WSL Finals in California in September. Currently ranked 18, Defay missed the first three tour events through injury. The reprieve means the pair will line up on the next event on the Championship Tour at the Surf Ranch in California, owned by Slater.</p>
                                <p>Brazilian Miguel Pupo and Brisa Hennessy of Costa Rica were awarded the 2024 season wildcards, which gives entry to all competitions in the first half of the next year’s CT season.</p>
