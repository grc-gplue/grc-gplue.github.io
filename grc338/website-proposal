					<h1> About Us </h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p>    In 1972, Makoa "Mugs" Kai was just 18 years old working for a local farming company over the summer when he noticed a great need for coffee during the team's early mornings of working on the field. Mugs began to make coffee for everyone every morning with the beans he had grown in his backyard, and his coffee was so tasty that everyone began to look forward to working at 4 A.M. just to taste it. Pretty soon, Mugs' only job on the farm was to make his delicious coffee of various flavors for everyone, including local passerbyers and tourists. After a year of crowds huddling around for coffee, he transformed the old farming shed into a coffee shop, a few renovations turned a local farmer into a Hawaiian caffeine legend. </p><!-- This is a placeholder!
